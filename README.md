# MedData
This project aims to create a simple way to analyze and compare different health factors and test results on small or large scales. <br>
This helps to view how different health factors may or may not have effects or relations with other factors or results.

## Work in progress
The project is currently under construction.

## Data
The current database in use for the project is a sample of perfectly distributed data. <br>
In practice real data could be used. <br>
This data could contain general information such as age and gender, and/or more precise data such as results from blood test and special medical conditions.
