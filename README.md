# MedData: UV Index Guide

UV radiation could cause a variety of different issues ranging from irritation to different types of skin cancer.<br>
The intensity of UV radiation present in any given location could be measured by the "UV Index".<br>
Once we understand the general harms of UV radiation, It becomes important to respond accordingly.<br>
This means limiting the time we spend outside and in the sun, and taking other protective measures such as using proper sun protection agents.<br>
<br>
Many cancer patients who are currently, or have gone through chemotheray and/or radiation therapy in the past, experience hightened skin sensitivity. This puts them in a more vulnerable position against the sun's radiation. 
This project aims to guide these patients in a way that is easy to understand and navigate, in taking the proper measures to be safer when it comes to the sun. Although targeted towards these patients, others with sensitive skin could also benefit from the finished project.

## Data
The project uses a json database, holding cities' names, longitude, and latitude information.
The file's source of data is [GeoNames Gazetteer](http://www.geonames.org/)

<br>
The project additionally accesses current time UV Index data from [Open Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/)


## Work in progress
The project is currently under construction and is being updated constantly.<br>
Next in queue of being added: 
- There will be guides suggesting actions according to the UV index in the user's selected city.
- There will be a chart to provide an overview to the entire day's uv index.
