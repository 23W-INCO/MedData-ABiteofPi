# MedData
This project aims to create a simple way to analyze and compare different health factors and test results on small or large scales.
This helps to view how different health factors may or may not have effects or relations with other factors or results.

## Work in progress
The project is currently under construction.

## Data
The current database in use for the project is a sample of perfectly distributed data.
In practice real data could be used. This data could contain general information such as age and gender, and/or more precise data such as results from blood test and special medical conditions.
